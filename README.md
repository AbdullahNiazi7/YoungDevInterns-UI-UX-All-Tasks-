üìö Core Concepts & Foundations (Week 1)
UI vs. UX Fundamentals:

UI: Focus on visual design (buttons, colors, layouts).

UX: Emphasis on user emotions, ease of use, and intuitive flows.

Example: Food delivery app with complex ordering = bad UX despite good UI.

Usability Principles:

Consistency, simplicity, feedback, and visibility.

Key rule: "Back" buttons must always behave predictably.

Design Thinking & Tools:

Process: Empathize ‚Üí Define ‚Üí Ideate ‚Üí Prototype ‚Üí Test.

Figma Basics: Frames, components, grids, and visual design (typography, spacing, color theory).

App Recreations: Wireframes for WhatsApp, YouTube, Spotify, and YT Music.

üöÄ Intermediate Skills (Week 2)
User Persona:

Created for "Muhammad Abdullah" (student, Foodpanda user) with goals, frustrations, and behaviors.

User Flows:

Mapped steps from app launch to order completion.

Wireframing:

Core pages: Home, Restaurant, and Cart screens.

‚öôÔ∏è Advanced Execution (Advanced Tasks)
Design System:

Built reusable components (buttons, cards, nav bars), styles (colors, fonts), and spacing rules.

Auto Layout & Variants: Streamlined responsive designs (e.g., button states).

Usability Testing:

Methods: Remote unmoderated tests via Maze/Google Forms.

Tasks: Validate Spotify nav flow and Ferrari F40 card clarity.

Iterations: Improved icon spacing, button labels, and hierarchy based on feedback.

UX Writing:

Crafted microcopy for Spotify ("Start Listening") and Ferrari ("Add to Cart") to enhance clarity and tone.

üçó Real-World Project (KFC Redesign)
Modern UI Prototype:

Dark/light theme toggle, hover interactions (red glow), loading animations.

Screens: Home, Search, Account, Settings.

Design System:

10+ components (buttons, cards, navigation), typography, color variables.

Usability Testing:

Feedback: Users praised theme switching and hover effects; requested better contrast (light mode) and larger logout button.

Refinements: Improved spacing, contrast, touch targets, and animation smoothness.

Key Themes Across All Work
Tools: Heavy reliance on Figma (prototyping, components, collaboration).

User-Centricity: Personas, testing, and iterative design informed all decisions.

Consistency: Design systems ensured uniformity across screens.

Practical Application: Concepts (UI/UX, design thinking) applied to real apps (Spotify, KFC).
